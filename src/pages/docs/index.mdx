# Welcome
Welcome to the FireAnIceBox wiki. This contains information about all parts of the server, whether its about mines, tiers, or other information about the server that might come useful to players.

## Ownership
This wiki has been coded originally by Giftedly, however since this project is fully-opensource, anybody can come and modify it. This wiki is completely on players experiences, and does not require any citation.

## Freedom of speech model
We allow any sort of speech, as long as it isn't too negative (as that would be disresepectful), and you will not get punished for writing (on server/wiki PRs/Discord) something that somebody doesn't like. **This should be kept in mind for both the reader and the person writing.**<br/>

### Example
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Acceptable**: <br/>
        "Some people think XYZ is weird". <br/>
        This would be protected under the Free Speech model and would not be punishable.
      </td>
      <td>
      **Unacceptable**: <br/>
      "XYZ is the weirdest person on this planet. He probably does......." <br/>
      This would **NOT** be protected under the Free Speech model, and could lead to the writer of this following speech to be punished.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Why?
Because the owner of this wiki (**Giftedly**), believes that there shouldn't be gray areas on *how the community interacted with a thing or person*, or *what postive/negative things came out of this thing or person*.

For more information, go to [the writing guidelines](/docs/writing).

## Unoffical(ish)
This wiki *was made without any resources from FireAnIceBox*, however was coded and wrote at its base from a *Mod on the team (aka Giftedly)*.

## Writing Resources
Please go to [the writing guidelines](/docs/writing).
Thank you.

## Cease
Ceasing can happen to resources that could be too sensitive to show, as they are [classified](/docs/classified). This can be achieved at [this page](/cease), by authority of FireAnIce.

So, see all of the resources on this server.
